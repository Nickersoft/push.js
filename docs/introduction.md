# What is Push?

Push is the fastest way to get up and running with Javascript desktop notifications. A fairly new addition to the official specification, the Notification API allows modern browsers such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge to push notifications to a user's desktop. Push acts as a cross-browser solution to this API, falling back to use older implementations if the user's browser does not support the new API.

## Installing 

You can quickly install Push via [npm](http://npmjs.com):

```bash
$ npm install push.js --save
```

Or, if you want something a little more lightweight, you can give [Bower](http://bower.io) a try:

```bash
$ bower install push.js --save
```
